# reasoning-geometry-probe

Probing hidden-state geometry in math reasoning.

The core question: when a language model generates a reasoning trace, does the *geometry* of its hidden states tell us something about correctness that token-level entropy misses? We fit a reference manifold (PCA + Gaussian) on hidden states from correct traces, then measure Mahalanobis distance for each new trace. The hypothesis is that incorrect reasoning deviates from this manifold even when the output distribution looks similar token-by-token.

Current evidence is the Best-of-8 MATH-500 runs on three models. Historical
greedy, transfer, temperature, and prefix runs remain under `results/` for
provenance but are not current evidence. See [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md) and
[EXPERIMENT_LOG.md](EXPERIMENT_LOG.md).

Several experiment families have been **retired after returning negative or null
results** — Best-of-N geometry reranking, prefix abort-and-retry filtering,
functional-trajectory encoding, and the PCA-dimension sweep. They are not
pending work; the questions are answered. The verdict and evidence for each is
in [EXPERIMENT_LOG.md](EXPERIMENT_LOG.md) under *2026-07-25: DVC graph
restructure*, and [notebooks/README.md](notebooks/README.md) indexes which
notebooks are current evidence versus archived diagnostics.

## Models and datasets

| Model | Architecture | Decoding |
|---|---|---|
| Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct | Qwen2.5, 28 layers, hidden dim 3584 | Best-of-8, layer 21, 1024-token budget |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B | Qwen2.5 lineage, reasoning distill | Best-of-8, layer 21, 8192-token budget |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B | Llama lineage, reasoning distill | Best-of-8, layer 24, 12288-token budget |
| Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct | Historical diagnostic; not current evidence | — |

Datasets: **MATH-500** (500 problems, 5 difficulty levels, 7 subjects) and **GSM8K** test set (~1300 problems).

## Current result

**Hidden-state geometry adds selective-prediction value on top of a
self-consistency baseline, on three models.** The claim is an *increment*, not a
score for the feature alone. Baseline `B0 = (length, entropy, logprob,
vote_agreement)` aggregated over 8 sibling traces; `B1 = B0 + rmd_tail_q20`,
the 20th percentile of relative Mahalanobis distance over the trace tail.
Out-of-fold logistic readouts, prompt-clustered paired bootstrap, 1000 draws.

On the cap-free valid-plurality population, in **AURC** (area under the
risk-coverage curve, lower is better):

| Model | n | `B1 − B0` |
|---|---:|---|
| Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct | 392 | −0.0585 [−0.1026, −0.0182] |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B | 393 | −0.0355 [−0.0642, −0.0097] |
| DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B | 408 | −0.0560 [−0.0910, −0.0232] |

Controls it survives: two difficulty controls, one of them MATH-500's exogenous
human-annotated level; a length residualization; DeepConf (arXiv:2508.15260) as
a prompt-level score, as a confidence-weighted vote, and as a confidence filter,
with all four of its statistics; and a vote-proxy control answering Orgad et al.
(arXiv:2410.02707) — geometry scores AUROC 0.71–0.83 *inside* the stratum where
the eight siblings agree unanimously and self-consistency is silent.

**This is a between-prompt result, and the within-prompt one is Qwen-specific.**
A pre-registered cross-model gate on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B failed
(2026-07-29): the localization effect is +0.004 [−0.016, +0.027], excluding
Qwen's +0.058, and *every* within-prompt AUC on that model — geometry and output
baselines alike — sits at or below chance.

The cross-model claim is therefore: **hidden-state geometry indicates which
problems are hard, not which attempt is right.** See
[EXPERIMENT_LOG.md](EXPERIMENT_LOG.md).

*Metric note: AURC and AUACC are affinely related at fixed n and both inherit the
base accuracy, so levels are not comparable across models — only deltas are.
AUROC is the base-rate-free metric and is used wherever a comparison crosses
models.*

## Setup

```bash
# Install uv if needed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install dependencies
uv sync
```

Requires Python 3.11+.

## Running the pipeline

The pipeline is managed with [DVC](https://dvc.org). Each stage collects hidden states or runs analysis for one model × dataset combination.

```bash
# Reproduce the current CPU analysis
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" uv run dvc repro --single-item evaluate_prompt_decomposition@0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" uv run dvc repro --single-item evaluate_wave1_experiments@0
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES="" uv run dvc repro --single-item evaluate_abstention_baselines@0

# Inspect the active graph
uv run dvc status
```

The default DAG contains the Qwen baseline, dense-layer/PCA checks,
truncation-budget diagnostics, Qwen Best-of-N decomposition, and Wave-1 CPU
follow-ups. Retired model-family and application stages are not
default dependencies; see the experiment log for their status.

Configuration is in [params.yaml](params.yaml): model names, layer indices, PCA dimension, bootstrap count, etc.

## Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `collect_data.py` | Run autoregressive generation, capture hidden states and per-token entropy, save `.npz` files |
| `analyze.py` | Fit reference manifold, extract features, run 5-fold CV logistic regression |
| `probe.py` | Trajectory probe: resample Mahalanobis sequence to fixed length, run functional PCA |
| `best_of_n.py` | Best-of-N reranking using geometry scores |
| `prefix_analysis.py` | Retired early-prefix diagnostic (historical) |

## Output structure

```
data/
  {model}/{dataset}/      # .npz files with hidden states (DVC-tracked, not in git)
results/
  {model}/{dataset}/      # metrics JSON + plots
  SUMMARY.md              # aggregated results table
```

## Features

Each trace is represented by 12 scalar features extracted from the per-token sequence:

- **Entropy-only (5)**: mean, max, std, 90th percentile, fraction above median
- **Mahalanobis-only (7)**: mean, max, std, 90th percentile distance; mean/max distance at high-entropy tokens; entropy–Mahal correlation
- **Combined (12)**: union of the above

The reference manifold is fitted on PCA(128) of hidden states from correct traces only, with a regularized Gaussian covariance.
